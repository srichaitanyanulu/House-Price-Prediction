# House-Price-Prediction
House Price Prediction using Hybrid ML Model

Housing prices fluctuate severely based on several factors. These factors mainly include size, location, and local amenities. But in some cases, these prices are overhyped rather than being based on proper valuation. Many of us might have encountered scenarios where we came across unreasonable house pricing based on one or two factors, which might not even matter to us. 

The essence of this project is to determine the housing prices based on various real-life factors that add value to a house. We require a model that considers all the essential parameters and generate a reasonable price, which is beneficial to the client and the seller. Due to this reason, we would like to use several Machine Learning algorithms and predict the housing prices rather than solely relying on a single algorithm. We can interpret different results determined by these algorithms and generalize a rule which will employ all these values. This rule will then determine the final housing price. This process would help in minimizing errors and getting more accurate results.
